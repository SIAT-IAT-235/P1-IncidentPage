## **Objective**

In this project, you will update your personal website with CSS and create a webpage **within that website** that presents details about **four AI incidents** based on rows from the provided dataset. The project will focus on building a semantically structured webpage using HTML and styling it with CSS. This assignment will help you understand web development fundamentals and prepare you for advanced features in future tasks.

> **Dataset:** [Key AI Incidents Dataset](https://github.com/SIAT-IAT-235/P1-IncidentPage/blob/main/Key_AI_Incidents.csv)
>
> **Details:** Create a new page within your website and update the content of that page.

## **Instructions**

### **Part 1: Update personal website**

1. **Update the appearance of your personal website using CSS**
   - Use ID, class, and element selectors.
   - Apply padding and margins to elements.
   - Ensure your design is consistent across all pages of your website.
     
2. **Note:** You will need to use the correct CSS styles based on the lecture slides. Your style and design are not graded, but try to make it look good :).

### **Part 2: Build the AI Incident Page**

1. **Create the HTML structure for the page:**
   - Use semantic HTML elements to organize your content meaningfully.
   - Ensure heading elements are sequenced logically and maintain proper hierarchy.
   - Focus on defining the meaning of the content without worrying about how it looks.

**Content Requirements:**
   - Create a new page for your personal website. Titled Project 1, within the page, you will add content from the provided dataset.
   - Select **four rows** from the dataset provided to build your page.
   - Your webpage must include the following sections for each incident:
     - **Header:** The title of the AI incident and a short description.
     - **Incident Details Section:** Include the following:
       - Date of the incident.
       - Location, if applicable.
       - Description of the incident.
     - **Impact Section:** Explain the incident's impact, including technical, social, and ethical considerations.
     - **References Section:** Cite sources or links related to the incident (from your research)

### **Part 3: CSS Styling**

1. **Style the AI incident page using CSS:**
   - Use CSS to define the look and feel of the webpage.
   - Override default HTML styles to create a visually appealing design.
   - Use `rem` units for font sizes and spacing (e.g., margins, paddings).
   - Apply consistent styling across all sections of the page.
   - Feel free to use any CSS style you want (font, image, hover, position, animation, etc.). However, make sure to use at least 3 style attributes for each HTML element.

2. **Visual Design Goals:**
   - Ensure your page is clean, professional, and emphasizes readability.
   - Use colors, fonts, and layout effectively to enhance the content presentation.
     
3. **Design Reflection:**
   - In two paragraphs, describe your potential viewer/reader persona. Explain why you have designed your webpage in a certain way in relation to that persona. Furthermore, elaborate on how your CSS design decisions align with the described persona (e.g., I guess my viewers are single females aged 25-35 who are interested in reading books. I have chosen these color codes and formatting for my headers because they are visually appealing to such viewers). There's no correct answer to this, we only want to learn more about your design mindset.
   - Include these paragraphs as **comments** in your HTML file.

### **Part 4: Deployment**

1. **Publish your project to GitHub Pages:**
   - Add the project as a new page to your personal website.
   - Include a link to the project page on your websiteâ€™s main navigation or an appropriate section.

2. **Validate Your Code:**
   - Use the W3C Validator to ensure your HTML and CSS are error-free.
   - Submit only validated code for grading.


---

## **Submission Instructions**

1. **Submit to GitHub Pages:**
   - Ensure your project is live on GitHub Pages and linked from your personal website.

2. **Submit on Canvas:**
   - Provide the link to your project page (hosted on GitHub Pages) on the **Project 1 Submission** page on Canvas.
